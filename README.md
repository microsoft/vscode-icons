# Figma
We also have these icons available in a public Figma file that is linked to our master library. We will try to keep the icons updated as much as we can.

## How to use
If you need to re-use an existing icon, simply select the icon you want to export and click on `Export` in the right panel:

You can also copy the SVG code if you'd prefer by right-clicking on the icon and going to `Copy As` > `Copy As SVG`:

If you are creating your custom icons and want to use the same colors as our icons, simply select a color from the color library in the right panel (we have a dark/light pairing for each one):

If you'd like to copy this page and make modifications, you can go ahead and make a copy to your drafts. Note that duplicating the file will break the link to the master components and you'll have to manually update the file when there are updates. To duplicate, click on the arrow next to the title name above and select `Duplicate to your Drafts`.
